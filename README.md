# **Project Overview**

### **Challenge**
A personal challenge — to learn how to work with commercial-style datasets, explore key product and business metrics, and apply them in practice.
### **Objectives**
Analyze revenue trends and overall business performance.
Study customer behavior and retention, build segmentation, and explore product and category performance.
### **Dataset & Tools**
Used the Kaggle **[eCommerce dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nabihazahid/ecommerce-dataset-for-sql-analysis?select=ecommerce_dataset_10000.csv)** ( 20 columns, 10,000 rows, data range: 2022-08-25-  2025-08-24)
Analysis performed in **PostgreSQL (SQL)** and visualization created in **Tableau Public**.
### **Approach**
6-stage comprehensive analytical workflow:
**1. Basic Analytics** —initial insights, category performance
**2. Revenue Metrics** — GMV, AOV, revenue per customer
**3. Customer Metrics** — LTV, retention, churn, repeat rate, cooling off rate
**4. Product Metrics** — category share, top products, product affinity
5. **Customer segmentation and RFM analysis**— customer value analysis, behavior patterns by gender, age, and geography

# Key Findings

- The Electronics category generates the majority of total revenue, while other categories show lower revenue but stronger sales volumes.
- Customers demonstrate high loyalty — about 69% make repeat purchases, although their second orders tend to have lower average value.
- The retention rate has been declining since late 2024, indicating weakening customer engagement.
